Hi, I'm Aguirre Matteo, a young student from a Tech School in Argentina.
I started to use Linux in 2024 and rapidly fell in love with the open source
community and decided to become a Linux SysAdmin. I'm currently learning all
the tools and skills that are needed in a typical job, like managing and 
configuring services such as DHCPs, DNSs, Web servers, and working with containers.

I've studied English for around 2-3 years, but mainly acquired it due to fully
immersing myself in the language and only consuming content in that language.
I could say I'm proficient at reading and writting text in English, but I still
have to practice my pronounciation.

I also self-studied Calculus and other advanced Math topics such as Statistics,
Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. I've a great foundation in Algebra,
which made it easier to learn those topics.

I store all my knowledge in the form of a blog in my personal website, so feel free to take a look at it! If you're looking for
someone focused in learning and doing the job the right way, then you're in
the right place.
